Hello and welcome to Shop-From-The-Future!
Here you can find some products that arent in the present yet and will never be! (its from the future, duh).

First of all, after downloading the files, the front and back end, you will need to create a .env in the backend dir, and inside put

PORT=5555
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://nadavzohar542:ss44ffppww%21%21@nadavzohar.kyfdatq.mongodb.net/shop-from-the-furute?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=nadavzohar"
JWT_SECRET="veryCool"

it is very importent!

Then open the Backend dir with the terminal and type nodemon, this will start the server.
And then open the Frontend dir with the terminal and type npm run dev, this will give u a little link to the site.

There is a Admin user in the site and a Regular one.

admin@gmail.com
regular@gmail.com

The password for each is Aa1234!

Of course you can signup yourself but it will only be a regular user, Admins are being set only by me ðŸ˜ˆ.

Inside you will see some products and the abilty to store them in your shopping cart or go straight to the checkout,
also there is some info about our products in the orbits and origins, and of course you can always contect us on the signal bridge.

We hope for a pleasent stay, and of course DONT PUT ANY REAL INFO !!!
